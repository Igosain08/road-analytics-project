                Using advanced clustering algorithms (DBSCAN and HDBSCAN), the system identifies 
                areas with high concentrations of accidents, considering both spatial proximity 
                and accident characteristics.

            <p>
                Understanding what factors contribute to accidents and their severity is 
                crucial for implementing effective safety measures.

            <p>
                This analysis shows how different factors like weather conditions, road conditions, 
                and time of day affect accident frequency and severity. The data reveals clear 
                patterns in when and where accidents are most likely to occur.

                This chart shows the distribution of accident severity levels, from minor incidents 
                to severe crashes. Understanding severity patterns helps prioritize safety interventions.

            <h2>Temporal Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Accident patterns vary significantly by time of day, day of week, and season. 
                Understanding these temporal patterns is essential for targeting safety measures.

            <h2>Predictive Models</h2>
            <p>
                Two machine learning models have been developed to predict different aspects 
                of road safety:

                    <h3>Accident Probability Model</h3>
                    <div class="number">83.2%</div>
                    <p>Accuracy in predicting where accidents occur</p>
                    <p>This model effectively identifies high-risk road segments</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="flex: 0 0 48%;">
                    <h3>Severity Prediction Model</h3>
                    <div class="number">23.4%</div>
                    <p>Accuracy in predicting accident severity (1-5 scale)</p>
                    <p>Severity prediction remains challenging due to complex factors</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The difference in performance between these models reflects the relative difficulty 
                of each prediction task. Location-based risk prediction works well with our road 
                network data, while severity prediction would benefit from additional data like 
                vehicle speeds, types, and occupancy.

                For a more interactive exploration of the data, the system includes a dashboard 
                that allows filtering and dynamic visualization of accident data.

            <p>
                Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made for improving road safety:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Target high-risk hotspots:</strong> Focus safety improvements on the 
                    identified accident clusters, particularly those with high severity ratings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implement time-based interventions:</strong> Increase enforcement and 
                    safety measures during high-risk time periods identified in the temporal analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Address weather-related risks:</strong> Improve road maintenance and 
                    warning systems during adverse weather conditions, particularly on high-risk road segments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modify high-risk road segments:</strong> Consider structural improvements 
                    to road segments identified as high-risk by the predictive model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conduct further analysis:</strong> Collect additional data on vehicle types, 
                    driver factors, and exact accident circumstances to improve severity prediction.
                </li>
            </ol>
